## Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm Valentina, a sophomore at Hunter College, exploring the exciting world of computer science! Still figuring things out, but enjoying the processâ€”especially when things *actually* work. ðŸ˜†  

- ðŸŒ± **Currently learning:** C++ and all the little quirks that come with it  
- ðŸ”­ **Working on:** Class projects and slowly building my coding confidence  
- ðŸ’¡ **Always open to:** Tips, advice, or connections!  
- âš¡ **Fun fact:**  I love hiking - bonus points if there's a pretty view at the top!  

Feel free to check out my projects or say hi! ðŸš€âœ¨
